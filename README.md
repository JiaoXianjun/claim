Welcome to [cowcoin.io](https://cowcoin.io), our open source initiative. By community - for community!

This instruction details all the steps the open source project maintainers must follow to claim CowCoin tokens.

1. In order for us to transfer tokens to your project, please add a file name .cowcoin into your project root folder, in which you put your ETH wallet ETH address.

2. Open a pull request to this repo, to add a new file.

- Filename: yourprojectname.md
- File content needs to provide the below info:

```
Project name:
Project URL:
Current number of stars/favourites:
```

3. To claim more tokens for the same project (like when your projects get more stars), do pull request to modify the same old filename, but add a new line after the existing content, so we can track how each project progresses.

4. To apply for grant, open pull request to modify the existing .md file of your project and add a new section with the below format.

```

The grant will be granted after a reviewing process.
