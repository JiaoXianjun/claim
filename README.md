Welcome to cowcoin.io, our open source incubator by community - for community!

This instruction details all the steps the open source project maintainers must follow to claim Cow tokens.

1. In order for us to transfer tokens to your project, please add a file name .cowcoin into your project root folder, in which you put your ETH wallet ETH address.

2. Make a tweet and tag 3 other projects, example "Hey, I'm collecting 2,000,000 token from @cowcoin_io calling @project1 @project2 @project3 now your turn" Remember, stronger the community, market value will be higher.

3. Open a pull request to this repo, to add a new file.

- Filename: yourprojectname.md
- File content needs to provide the below info:

```
Project name:
Project URL:
Current number of stars/favourites:
```

4. To claim more tokens for the same project (like when your projects get more stars), do pull request to modify the same old filename, but add a new line after the existing content, so we can track how each project progresses.

5. To apply for grant, open pull request to modify the existing .md file of your project and add a new section with the below format.

```
[ Grant ]
Reason to ask for grant:
Number of tokens to apply:
Details on your development roadmap:
```

The grant will be granted after a reviewing process.
